    <p>
        While conducting design research for projects like OpenCongress and OpenFederal, I found that the
        resources at hand were sufficient for providing an introduction to various methodologies. But when it came time
        for actual implementation and execution. I felt there was a sizeable knowledge gap that left my team members and
        I with questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This open-source design research guide seeks to close that knowledge gap with real world examples of methods and case studies
        for conducting design research and design thinking exercises.

        The guide is in currently progress at <a class="link" href="http://designresearch.is">designresearch.is</a>.
